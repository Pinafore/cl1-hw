\section*{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}
First, check out the Github repository with the course homework templates:

\url{git://github.com/ezubaric/cl1-hw.git}

The goal of this assignment is to create a piece of code that will
determine whether a poem is a
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick_(poetry)}{limerick} or
not.  To do this, we will be using the
\href{http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict}{CMU pronunciation
  dictionary} (which is covered in the \href{http://www.nltk.org/book/ch02.html}{second chapter of the NLTK book}).

A limerick is defined as a poem with the form AABBA, where the A lines
rhyme with each other, the B lines rhyme with each other (and not the
A lines).  (English professors may disagree with this definition, but
that's what we're using here to keep it simple.  There are also
constraints on how many syllables can be in a line.)

\section*{Programming Section (40 points)}

Look at the file \texttt{limerick.py} in the hw1 folder.  Your job is to fill
in the missing functions in that file so that it does what it’s
supposed to do.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf rhyme}: detect whether two words rhyme or not
\item {\bf limerick}: given a candidate limerick, return whether it meets the
constraint or not.
\end{itemize}
More requirements / information appear in the source files.

\clearpage

\noindent \textbf{Notes}:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf What does it mean for two words to rhyme?}

They should share the same sounds in their pronunciation except for their first consonant sound(s).  (This is a very strict definition of rhyming.  This makes the assignment easier.)  If one word is longer than the other, then the sounds of shorter word (except for its first consonant) should be a suffix of the sounds of the longer.

\item {\bf How do I know if my code is working?}

Run the provided unit tests:

\texttt{python tests.py}

in the homework directory.  Initially, many of them will fail.  If your program is working correctly, all of them will pass.  However, the converse is not true: passing all the tests is not sufficient to demonstrate that your code is working.  \emph{This is strongly encouraged, as it will be similar to how your code is graded.}

\item {\bf How do I separate words from a string of text?}

Use the \texttt{word\_tokenize} function.

\item {\bf What if a word isn’t in the pronouncing dictionary?}

Assume it doesn’t rhyme with anything and only has one syllable.

\item {\bf How ``hardened'' should the code be?}

It should handle ASCII text with punctuation and whitespace in upper or lower case.

\item {\bf What if a word has multiple pronunciations?}

If a word like “fire” has multiple pronunciations, then you should say
that it rhymes with another word if any of the pronunciations rhymes.

\item {\bf What if a word starts with a vowel?}

Then it has no initial consonant, and then the entire word should be a
suffix of the other word.

% Note for the future: change this to clarify that end rhymes are not rhymes
% also check the unit tests to make sure this is not allowed

\item {\bf What about end rhymes?}

End rhymes are indeed a rhyme, but they make for less interesting
limericks.  So ``conspire'' and ``fire'' do rhyme.

\item {\bf What about stress?}

The stresses of rhymes should be consistent.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Extra Credit}

Extra Credit (create new functions for these features; don’t put them
in the required functions that will be run by the autograder):
\begin{itemize}
\item[(up to 2 points)] Create a new function called
  \texttt{apostrophe\_tokenize} that handles apostrophes in words correctly so
  that ``can’t'' would rhyme with ``pant'' if the \texttt{is\_limerick} function used \texttt{apostrophe\_tokenize} instead of \texttt{word\_tokenize}.
\item[(up to 5 points)] Make reasonable guesses about the number of syllables in unknown words in a function called \texttt{guess\_syllables}.
\item[(up to 5 points)] Compose a funny original limerick about
  computational linguistics, natural language processing, or machine
  learning (add it to your submission as \texttt{limerick.txt}).
\end{itemize}
Add extra credit code as functions to the \texttt{LimerickDetector}
class, but don't interfere with required functionality.
